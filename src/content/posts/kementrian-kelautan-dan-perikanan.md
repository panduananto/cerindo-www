# Supporting Sustainable Aquaculture: Logistics Success for Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan RI

Building a sustainable future for Indonesia’s fisheries sector starts with strong logistics. As part of our collaboration with the **Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan Republik Indonesia (KKP RI)**, we successfully managed the transportation of key materials for **fish farming projects** across the archipelago.

Our deliveries supported aquaculture developments in **Sabang**, **Pangandaran**, and **Karimunjawa**, ensuring vital equipment reached each project site safely and on time.

Here’s what we made happen:

- **43 containers** of mooring systems, cages, and nets from **Norway**
- **4 containers** of brackets for sinker tubes from **China**
- **3 feeding barges** from **Vietnam**
- **2 work boats** from **Batam** to assist with local transportation

Each shipment required precise coordination and careful handling — from ocean freight to on-site delivery. Through our team’s dedication, we’ve already completed **73 successful shipments**, contributing to the advancement of Indonesia’s blue economy.

Behind every shipment lies a shared commitment: to support sustainable fish farming and empower coastal communities across the nation.
