# Powering Maritime Innovation: Logistics Partnership with PT PAL Indonesia

Indonesia’s shipbuilding industry relies on precision, timing, and trust — and we’re proud to be part of that mission. In partnership with **PT PAL Indonesia**, we handled the logistics for multiple high-impact maritime projects, ensuring critical components arrived safely and on schedule.

From **Korea to Surabaya**, our team managed a complex series of deliveries that supported a range of national shipbuilding and marine engineering programs. These included:

- Ship materials for **Palwo Bowono**
- Ship components for the **Palpass 500 Project**
- Equipment for **Fast Patrol Ships** for **Indonesian Customs**
- Modules and parts for **FPU (Floating Production Unit)** for **PT Pertamina**
- Two **MPC Project units**
- **8PA5L Main Diesel Engine**
- **PB1600 Auxiliary Main Diesel Engine**

Every shipment demanded technical precision and strict coordination across multiple international partners and ports.

In total, we’ve completed **567 successful deliveries**, a milestone that reflects our unwavering commitment to reliability and excellence in maritime logistics.

Each voyage we support strengthens Indonesia’s maritime capabilities — and we’re proud to help power that progress.
