# Driving Connectivity Across Indonesia: How We Support Telkomsel’s Nationwide Telecom Logistics

When Indonesia’s largest mobile network provider needs reliable logistics support, they turn to us. As the **official house forwarder for Telkomsel**, we’ve proudly played a key role in strengthening the country’s digital backbone.

Our expertise extends far beyond moving boxes — it’s about delivering connectivity. From 2004 to 2006, we managed a **bonded warehouse** dedicated to telecom equipment, ensuring every shipment met customs requirements and moved efficiently through the **Priority Lane facility**. This special access helped accelerate the delivery of critical components to **district capitals across Indonesia**, supporting Telkomsel’s mission to expand nationwide coverage.

In just two years, our team successfully handled **over 12,700 shipments** — a milestone that reflects our commitment to precision, speed, and reliability.

Our export services include:

- Warehouse management & export documentation
- Shipment arrangement & container stuffing
- Trucking, haulage, and ocean freight coordination

Behind every shipment is a promise: to keep Indonesia connected, one delivery at a time.
